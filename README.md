This is an implementation of the image completion model proposed in the paper
([Globally and Locally Consistent Image Completion](
http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/%7Eiizuka/projects/completion/data/completion_sig2017.pdf))
in Pytorch 0.4.

# Requirements

- Python 3
- Pytorch 0.4
- TensorbardX
- argparser
- etc (PIL, tqdm...)

# Usage

## I. Prepare the training data
 This step is pre-pocessing of the image (make random mask)
 and transform image to torch tensor.
```
$ cd src_gl
$ python prepare_dataset2tensor.py
```

in github. I already uploaded "Facade dataset" with test and train.
You can put any of datasets in data folder

And also you can change image size, maske size, maske margine
```
$ python prepare_dataset2tensor.py --patchSize 256 --patchSize 128 --boundary_margin 8
```
## II. Train model

Train the "GL" model with pre-processed tensor data in step I.
```
$ cd src_gl
$ python train.py
```
## III. Evaluate model
```
$ cd src_gl
$ python eval.py
```
